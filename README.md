# Assignment #3.5 (***EXTRA CREDIT***): List - Doubly Linked List Implementation


*Due **Friday, October 13th, 2017 @ 11:59PM EST***

## Directions
Redo Programming Assignment 3 with the following modifications:
-	Use a **doubly** linked list to implement the list. 
-	Use the `LinkedList.h` file given to implement the **doubly** linked list.
-	Create the `LinkedList.cpp` file to implement the methods of the LinkedList class.
-	Use the same client file that you used in Programming Assignment 2 & 3.

This program is worth half of a normal programming assignments (50 points rather than 100) there will be **no late submissions** accepted. **ALL** methods must be updated utilizing both the `prev` and `next` nodes with the exceptions being `Empty()`, `Average()`, `Median()`, & `InsertAtEnd()`


Write a program to create a single list. Your client code should be menu driven using the following menu options:

```
  1. Insert
  2. Delete
  3. Display
  4. Sort
  5. Average 
  6. Median
  7. Shuffle
  8. Exit
```
**Option 1:** Prompt the user for a non-empty string to insert at the end of the list.

**Option 2:** Prompt the user for which string to remove from list. Remove every instance of the value specified.

**Option 3:** Display all of the values in the list.

**Option 4:** Sort the values in the list based on string length from shortest to longest.

**Option 5:** Find the average length of the strings in the list and display it.

**Option 6:** Find the medium length of the strings in the list and display it.

**Option 7:** Shuffle the strings in the list around.

**Option 8:** Exit the program.
